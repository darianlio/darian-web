        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Darian. Interested to learn more? Born in Toronto, Canada, I am a twenty-two year old who is currently in his last year of study for Computer Engineering at Queen's University. 
            <br/><br/>From an early age, I have always been interested in everything that had to do with technology, design, and development. From building robots, playing games, to designing applications, my curiosity has only grown through the years. 
            <br/><br/>I had the pleasure to intern for IBM as a Software Developer. It was a great experience that has really helped improve my fundamental abilities for work! Now, I'm currently an upcoming software engineer at Amazon! Stay tuned!</p>
